/**
 * Interface representing all variables
 *
 * Variables could have a different storage type: stack or heap
 * They could be allocated at different levels: object or local
 * The could be used in situations such as assignment or reference
 *
 * Primitve variables are pretty simple to deal with. It is more diffucult to deal with object
 * type variables of which there are two kinds: owner and reference.
 *
 * An owner variable is a pointer to a struct where the struct represents the object.
 * Owner variable is stored somewhere. If owner variable is local then it is stored in on a stack
 * allocated memory that was allocated using alloc command. If an owner variable is stored in an
 * object then it is stored in a field that has a type Struct*. Either way the variable that
 * represents an object owner has type Struct**.
 *
 * Reference variables refer to an object owner. Thus local reference would be a pointer to owner.
 * This translates into a type Struct**. The local reference is stored in a variable created using
 * alloc command. That variable has type Struct***.
